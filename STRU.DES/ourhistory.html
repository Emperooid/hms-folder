        <h2>The Sacred Cherubim & Seraphim Church</h2>
        <p>
          The Sacred Cherubim & Seraphim Church is one of the most prominent
          indigenous churches in Nigeria.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Cherubim and Seraphim society is a distinct section of the
          Aladura founded by Moses Orimolade Tunolase, a Yoruba prophet, and
          Christiana Abiodun Akinsowon, an Anglican who had experienced visions
          and trances. In 1925–26 they formed the society, with doctrines of
          revelation and divine healing replacing…

          Aladura, (Yoruba: “Owners of Prayer”), religious movement among the
          Yoruba peoples of western Nigeria, embracing some of the independent
          prophet-healing churches of West Africa. The movement, which in the
          early 1970s had several hundred thousand adherents, began about 1918
          among the younger elite in the well-established Christian community.
          They were dissatisfied with Western religious forms and lack of
          spiritual power and were influenced by literature from the small U.S.
          divine-healing Faith Tabernacle Church of Philadelphia. The 1918 world
          influenza epidemic precipitated the formation of a prayer group of
          Anglican laymen at Ijebu-Ode, Nigeria; the group emphasized divine
          healing, prayer protection, and a puritanical moral code. By 1922
          divergences from Anglican practice forced the separation of a group
          that became known as the Faith Tabernacle, with several small
          congregations. The main expansion occurred when a prophet-healer,
          Joseph Babalola (1906–59), became the centre of a mass divine-healing
          movement in 1930. Yoruba religion was rejected, and pentecostal
          features that had been suppressed under U.S. influence were restored.
          Opposition from traditional rulers, government, and mission churches
          led the movement to request help from the pentecostal Apostolic Church
          in Britain. Missionaries arrived in 1932, and the Aladura movement
          spread and consolidated as the Apostolic Church. Problems arose over
          the missionaries’ use of Western medicines—clearly contrary to
          doctrines of divine healing—their exclusion of polygamists, and their
          assertion of full control over the movement. In 1938–41 the ablest
          leaders, including Babalola and Isaac B. Akinyele (later Sir), formed
          their own Christ Apostolic Church, which by the 1960s had 100,000
          members and its own schools and had spread to Ghana. The Apostolic
          Church continued its connection with its British counterpart; other
          secessions produced further “apostolic” churches. The Cherubim and
          Seraphim society is a distinct section of the Aladura founded by Moses
          Orimolade Tunolase, a Yoruba prophet, and Christiana Abiodun
          Akinsowon, an Anglican who had experienced visions and trances. In
          1925–26 they formed the society, with doctrines of revelation and
          divine healing replacing traditional charms and medicine. They
          separated from the Anglican and other churches in 1928. In the same
          year the founders parted, and further divisions produced more than 10
          major and many minor sections, which spread widely in Nigeria and to
          Benin (formerly Dahomey), Togo, and Ghana. The Church of the Lord
          (Aladura) was started by Josiah Olunowo Oshitelu, an Anglican
          catechist and schoolteacher, whose unusual visions, fastings, and
          devotions led to his dismissal in 1926. By 1929 he was preaching
          judgment on idolatry and native charms and medicines, uttering
          prophecies, and healing through prayer, fasting, and holy water. The
          Church of the Lord (Aladura), which he founded at Ogere in 1930,
          spread to north and east Nigeria, Ghana, Liberia, Sierra Leone, and
          beyond Africa—New York City and London—where several other Aladura
          congregations also meet. The Aladura movement continues to grow and
          includes many small secessions, ephemeral groups, prophets with one or
          two congregations, and healing practitioners.

      <h3>The Origin Of The Church</h3>
      <p>
        The history of Cherubim & Seraphim Church is woven around one man called
        Moses Orimolade Tunolase. It is strongly belief that no man can found a
        Church except God, therefore it is safe to say C&S Church was founded by
        God Almighty through Saint Moses Orimolade Tunolase. When the Band was first established, it was named the Band of Cherubs, also known as “Egbe Aladura” because it seems that it was established solely to wage ‘war’ with prayers

      </p><br>
      <p>At inception, the “EGBE ALADURA”. When it was time to have a name that would be given to the Church, St. Moses Orimolade told members to observe three-day prayers and fasting about the naming of the sect. When the people reassembled on the third day, a female member, whose name was not identified, revealed that she saw in the sky, the previous night’s letter “SE”. Another member said he saw “RA” but both could not see the rest of the letters. The members could not reach a beautiful decision that evening and St. Moses Orimolade dismissed them to go home and pray more about it.
        
      </p><br>
      <p>On Wednesday 9 September 1925, Orimolade invited all the members outside at about 9 a.m. They all knew that something important was about to take place as they clapped and danced. There Reverend J. C. Barber, a Clergy of the United Native African Church (UNA) from Ode-Irele Okitipupa division who was a regular attendant of Orimolade’s prayer meetings interpreted the letters to be “SE-RA-FU” (SERAPH). Orimolade told them to sing all the verses of K&S 338 ‘Bugbe Re ti l’ewa to! Orimolade concluded prayers facing East and said with a loud voice, ‘JAH JEHOVAH’! In the name of the Father and of the Son and the Holy Spirit, today this Band is named “SERAFU” (Seraph). After this, many people dreamt and it was even revealed to Orimolade himself that the Angels in heaven were unhappy because of what Orimolade did. It was said that two Angels were working with Moses Orimolade (The Cherubim & Seraphim) and he named his Church on earth after one. He was told to make an amendment. This was why on 26 March 1927, the name “CHERUBIM” was added. Since that day the Church had been named “CHERUBIM & SERAPHIM”. That day, Orimolade prophesy that this Holy Band shall spread all over the earth and nobody would be able to stop it. Then, he told them again that before fifty years the church shall be founded in the white man’s country.

      </p><br>
      <p>Several years after the creation of the Cherubim & Seraphim, different denominations following in its traditions broke off and formed new churches. By the 1940s, the Aladura Movement Church had begun to spread throughout the world, from places in Africa to other English-speaking countries, such as the United States of America and the United Kingdom.
